# FractionApp

A Java application which simulates a fraction calculator. The app asks the user to enter integer values for a numerator and denominator of a fraction. It will present a range of options for the user to perform operations on the fraction, such as displaying it as a decimal, showing its reciprocal value, or reducing it to its lowest terms. It will also allow the user to enter a second fraction then do arithmetic operations on them, such as adding them or multiplying them together.
